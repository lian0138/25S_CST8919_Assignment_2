# CST8919 â€“ DevOps Security and Compliance: Cloud Service Alternatives Report

## 1. Find the AWS & GCP Equivalents
Now that I've listed the Azure services from the course, I went ahead and found the closest matching services in AWS and GCP. I focused on how they handle similar tasks like managing identities, monitoring data, enforcing policies, securing postures, and running SIEM operations, pulling from official docs and some online comparison guides to make sure they fit well.

For Azure Active Directory, AWS uses IAM combined with Cognito for access and authentication, while GCP relies on IAM with Cloud Identity for workforce management. Azure Monitor & Log Analytics aligns with AWS CloudWatch for metrics and logs, and GCP's Operations Suite for monitoring. Azure Policy is similar to AWS Organizations with Config for governance, and GCP's Organization Policy Service for constraints. Defender for Cloud matches AWS Security Hub, plus GuardDuty and Inspector for threat and vulnerability scanning, and GCP's Security Command Center for posture. Finally, Azure Sentinel corresponds to AWS GuardDuty with Security Hub and Lambda for detection and automation, and GCP's Chronicle with Security Command Center for SIEM analytics.

## 2. Compare the Services
In this part, I'll compare each Azure service to its AWS and GCP equivalents using straightforward tables. Each table covers a quick overview, core features, security and compliance aspects, pricing, and how they integrate with DevSecOps, based on course emphasis on things like threat detection in logs or automated responses in scenarios.

The comparisons show where Azure often feels more unified, especially for hybrid setups like in the SecureCorp case, while AWS tends to be more modular and scalable, and GCP leans into AI-driven tools. I kept the tables simple for easy reading, highlighting key similarities and differences without going overboard.
